# example-code
sample code showing projects I have been involved in.

This repository was a compilation of projects for employers to view as I was applying for an internship over the Summer of 2019. Please contact me via email (coxs4@wit.edu)
to see or discuss more recent work. Please also refer to my Senior Project https://github.com/coxs4/A-Seeker for my Senior Project, which is the most recent project I was involved in.

Thanks for checking me out! :)
